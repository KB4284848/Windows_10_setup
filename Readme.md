This repository contains my autounattend.xml file to automatize Windows Pro installation (generated using NTLite software (https://www.ntlite.com) (to allow you to have to click only once to launch Windows setup and then get a coffee/do whatever you want instead of having to click a thousand of times to choose installation settings). It assumes french layout however while not tested replacing `fr-FR` and `fr` values by `en-GB` should assume UK layouts. It also enables hidden super administrator of Windows and automatically launch its session at the end of the installation.

You can find more informations about how to integrate autounattend.xml there https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs

I also included a few registry keys that I use on my machines and linked to what they do in the comments of the reg files.
